# Energy Consumption Prediction

## Problem Statement

In the modern world, energy management is a critical issue for both households and energy providers. Predicting energy consumption accurately enables better planning, cost reduction, and optimization of resources. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict household energy consumption based on historical data. Using this model, consumers can gain insights into their usage patterns, while energy providers can forecast demand more effectively.

By the end of this project, learners should provide actionable insights into energy usage trends and deliver a predictive model that can help optimize energy consumption for households or serve as a baseline for further research into energy management systems.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Gather historical energy consumption data from various sources.
   - Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, trends, and patterns.
   - Visualize the data to identify key features that influence energy consumption.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features that may improve the prediction accuracy of the model.
   - Select the most relevant features for the model.

4. **Model Development**
   - Build and train machine learning models to predict household energy consumption.
   - Evaluate the performance of different models and select the best one.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Use appropriate metrics to assess the performance of the predictive model.
   - Compare the results with baseline models or existing solutions.

6. **Insights and Recommendations**
   - Provide actionable insights into energy usage trends for households.
   - Offer recommendations for optimizing energy consumption based on the model's predictions.
