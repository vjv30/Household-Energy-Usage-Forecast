HOUSEHOLD ENERGY CONSUMPTION PREDICTION

OVERVIEW

This project develops a machine learning model to predict household energy consumption using historical data. It helps consumers understand their energy usage and allows energy providers to forecast demand more effectively.

KEY USE CASES

HOUSEHOLDS: Monitor energy usage and reduce bills.

ENERGY PROVIDERS: Improve demand forecasting.

ANOMALY DETECTION: Identify irregular consumption patterns.

SMART GRIDS: Enable real-time energy optimization.

APPROACH

DATA PROCESSING: Clean, preprocess, and engineer features.

MODEL TRAINING: Train models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

EVALUATION: Compare models using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.

INSIGHTS: Visualize trends and optimize energy consumption.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

PYTHON (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

DATA VISUALIZATION (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

HOW TO RUN

git clone https://github.com/your-username/household-energy-forecast.git
